# Cybersecurity Club Application

##  About Me

**Name: Arush Barure

I am a Computer Science Engineering student specilization in Datascience but  with a strong interest in cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and digital privacy.
I enjoy understanding how systems break, how attackers think, and how security professionals defend against real-world threats .

My goal is to eventually work in advanced security research and build automated defensive tools ("cyber bots") that can monitor and protect users online 24x7.

## 💭 Why I Want to Join the Whitehats Club

I want to join the Whitehats Club because cybersecurity is not just a subject to me — it is a field I genuinely want to build my career in.

The club environment will help me:

* Learn practical skills beyond classroom theory
* Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions
* Collaborate with people who share the same interest
* Gain hands-on experience with real attack and defense techniques

I believe cybersecurity is one of the most important skills today because almost every aspect of modern life depends on the internet — banking, communication, identity, and privacy.
Being part of the club will help me grow from a learner into a practitioner.



###= Malicious Chrome Extensions & Data Theft

Recently, several browser extensions — including ad blockers and productivity tools — were discovered stealing sensitive user data. This shows that even trusted browser add-ons can become a security risk.

### What Happened?

Security researchers found that some Chrome extensions:

* Collected browsing history
* Read cookies and session tokens
* Accessed login pages
* Tracked user activity across websites

In some cases, the extensions were **sold to new developers** who then pushed malicious updates.
Users trusted the extension because it had millions of downloads and good reviews.

### Why This Is Dangerous

Browser extensions often request powerful permissions such as:

* "Read and change all your data on all websites"

This effectively gives them control similar to malware.
Attackers can use this to:

* Hijack accounts
* Track users
* Inject ads
* Redirect banking sessions
* Steal authentication cookies

This is especially dangerous because antivirus software usually does NOT detect malicious extensions.




**Trust ≠ Security**
